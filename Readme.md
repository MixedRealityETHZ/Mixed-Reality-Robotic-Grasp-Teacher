 # Mixed Reality Robotic Grasp Teacher
 
 The **Mixed Reality Robotic Grasp Teacher** is a software developed for the mixed reality headset Microsoft HoloLens 2. It uses the built-in hand-tracking feature of the goggles to allow the user to teach with their hands, a trajectory and grasping motion of an object with a six-degrees-of-freedom robot equipped with a gripper. 
A digital twin of the object is used for the teaching. The operator can interact with it in the virtual environment of the HoloLens. It is comfortably placed for the userâ€™s hand to show the grasping motion.
The trajectory is also taught on a digital twin of the scanned environment. This makes object avoidance more intuitive and independent of any path planner as well as collision detection algorithms.
