 # Mixed Reality Robotic Grasp Teacher
 
 The **Mixed Reality Robotic Grasp Teacher** is a software developed for the mixed reality headset Microsoft HoloLens 2. It uses the built-in hand-tracking feature of the goggles to allow the user to teach with their hands, a trajectory and grasping motion of an object with a six-degrees-of-freedom robot equipped with a gripper. 
A digital twin of the object is used for the teaching. The operator can interact with it in the virtual environment of the HoloLens. It is comfortably placed for the userâ€™s hand to show the grasping motion.
The trajectory is also taught on a digital twin of the scanned environment. This makes object avoidance more intuitive and independent of any path planner as well as collision detection algorithms.

## Setup

The app was tested on Unity 2021.3.11f1 and built with Visual Studio 2022.

First, clone this repository to a local folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/MixedRealityETHZ/Mixed-Reality-Robotic-Grasp-Teacher.git
```
Open the Unity Hub > Open > Add new project from disk

The app was developped with the MRTK 2.8.2 and OpenXR 1.5.1

Install the [MixedRealityFeatureTool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool) in the folder containing the cloned repository.

In order to enhance the experience with the app, the enviornment mesh overlay, as well as the hand overlay can be removed:
While Mixed Realty Toolkit is selected, in the inspector
 - Under Input > Articulated Hand Tracking > Visualization Settings: both Hand Mesh Vizualisation Modes and Hand Joint Vizualisation Modes shall be turned off to Nothing.
 - Under Spatial Awarness, untick Enable Spatial Awareness System.

The rest of the standard export setting for HoloLens are working.

## Building the app

In order to build the app, go to File > Build Settings... Then Universal Windows Platform, change Architecture to ARM 64-bit and clock Build.
Open the generated .sln file in visual Studio. in the top menu, change Debug to Release; the architecture to ARM64; Select Run on Device while the Hololens are connected to the computer.
